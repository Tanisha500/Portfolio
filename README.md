## About Me

I am an AI Automation Specialist with a strong focus on building reliable, structured, and human-safe automation systems. My work centers on designing workflows that reduce manual effort while maintaining clarity, control, and sound judgment.

I approach automation through systems thinking—breaking complex problems into clear, manageable processes and integrating AI only where it adds real value. Rather than chasing novelty, I focus on building workflows that are predictable, explainable, and adaptable across different business contexts.

I work extensively with no-code / low-code automation, LLM-powered logic, and API-driven integrations, ensuring that AI-driven systems remain stable, auditable, and easy to reason about.

## Key Highlights

* **RAG-Based Telegram Policy Assistant Bot** – Real-time document-based Q&A system using Groq API and n8n.
* **Form-to-Article Generator** – Converts form inputs into AI-generated blog content automatically.
* **Customer Feedback Auto-Classifier** – Classifies reviews (Positive, Negative, Neutral) and generates summaries in Google Sheets.
* **Text-to-Speech Automation** – Uses ElevenLabs + Google Drive API for seamless audio file creation and upload.

Each project reflects my goal of combining **automation, AI, and usability** to create scalable, intelligent systems.
