## About Me

I am an AI Automation Specialist with a strong focus on building reliable, structured, and human-safe automation systems. My work centers on designing workflows that reduce manual effort while maintaining clarity, control, and sound judgment.

I approach automation through systems thinking—breaking complex problems into clear, manageable processes and integrating AI only where it adds real value. Rather than chasing novelty, I focus on building workflows that are predictable, explainable, and adaptable across different business contexts.

I work extensively with no-code / low-code automation, LLM-powered logic, and API-driven integrations, ensuring that AI-driven systems remain stable, auditable, and easy to reason about.

## Key Projects

* **AI Operations Assistant – Order Intelligence System:**
Designed an automation system to analyze incoming operational queries, classify intent, extract relevant context, and route actions appropriately. The system reduced manual handling while ensuring decisions remained controlled and auditable.

* **RAG-Based Telegram Policy Assistant:**
Developed a document-aware conversational assistant that answers user queries using internal policy documents via retrieval-augmented generation, delivering accurate, context-grounded responses through Telegram.

* **Customer Feedback Auto-Classifier:**
Created an automated pipeline that analyzes customer feedback, classifies sentiment (Positive, Neutral, Negative), and generates structured summaries to reduce manual review effort.

* **Judgment Agent:**
Built an AI-assisted judgment agent that evaluates incoming requests using structured criteria such as intent, authority, and risk before deciding whether to proceed, defer, or escalate. The system combines rule-based logic with LLM reasoning to ensure safe, controlled, and explainable automation.
