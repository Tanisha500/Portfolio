## About Me

Driven by curiosity and a vision to simplify complex systems, I specialize in **AI automation**, **no-code workflow development**, and **intelligent integrations**.
I design and build automation systems that connect data, people, and AI to make operations smarter, faster, and more efficient.

I create **AI-powered automations**, **chatbots**, and **data-driven workflows** using tools like **n8n**, **Zapier**, and **Make**, integrated with **OpenAI**, **Groq**, and **Google APIs**.
My focus is on building **human-centric automation** — blending AI with no-code logic to solve real-world business problems and deliver measurable results.

## Key Highlights

* **RAG-Based Telegram Policy Assistant Bot** – Real-time document-based Q&A system using Groq API and n8n.
* **Form-to-Article Generator** – Converts form inputs into AI-generated blog content automatically.
* **Customer Feedback Auto-Classifier** – Classifies reviews (Positive, Negative, Neutral) and generates summaries in Google Sheets.
* **Text-to-Speech Automation** – Uses ElevenLabs + Google Drive API for seamless audio file creation and upload.

Each project reflects my goal of combining **automation, AI, and usability** to create scalable, intelligent systems.
